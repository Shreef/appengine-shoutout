AppEngine-Shoutout
==================

this app started at Google Egypt's day 2 code competition. a session were given about creating 
a simple shoutout app using Google's AppEngine SDK, and they requested to enhance that code 
and add more features. while this app didn't make it to the finals as it's very simple, I thought
that this code can help others to see some very simple examples and I will try to enhance this 
application later whenever I get time -isA-.


Current features
----------------
- on main page, anyone can add a new shoutout
- admins only can delete shoutouts
- when a new shoutout is added, the app will try to send IM message to the admin
- if sending IM message fails, it willl send email to the admin instead


How to run it
-------------
after downloading AppEngine's SDK, extract the content of the zipped file and in a terminal run 

> dev_appserver.py /path/to/project/dir

then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser


*I know, this code isn't well structured, but I will try to enhance it later*
